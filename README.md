Hello, I'm Tonya. I'm a transformational engineering leader, advisor, architect, engineer (software and electrical), and a developer of web developers and software makers.

I have a knack for breaking down complexity, explaining the why and when of it, and building pathways for technical professionals to grow and excel. It's been the essence of my 30+ year career.
